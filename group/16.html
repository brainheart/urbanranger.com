currently I am a stay at home Mom. You would think I could get enough
exercise chasing after my 7,5,3,and 1 year olds, but no. As someone
once put it, &quot;it may be work but it sure aint exercise. Maybe I will
just call some friends and see if they want to walk to the park nearby
with my kids and theirs. who knows maybe I could make it fun,picnic
and all. thanx for the advice. Your friend in health, Melanie

&gt; Hi Melanie,
&gt; 
&gt; I think the critical thing, as with no s, is not to
&gt; fixate on one off excuses to do the right thing (these
&gt; are great as a supplement), but to build a regular,
&gt; daily habit. You don't want to have to think &quot;where
&gt; and when should I walk today?&quot; every day. It should be
&gt; routine. Your feet should know. Can you walk to and
&gt; from work? That's ideal. Maybe do less once a month
&gt; mega-shopping and walk to the store to buy at least
&gt; some of your dinner fresh every day (you may also find
&gt; this helps a lot with planning sensible meals). If
&gt; there is no one errand you could arrange to have to do
&gt; every day, then at least be sure to start moving at a
&gt; certain time. You'll think better in motion; a
&gt; destination will occur to you.
&gt; 
&gt; The nice thing about walking is that because it's so
&gt; pleasant, you don't need as much willpower as with,
&gt; say, jogging, to get started each day. But it still
&gt; requires some. You need to take it seriously. Make it
&gt; non-optional, a top priority. As with diet, the hard
&gt; part is at the beginning. Once it's a habit, your feet
&gt; carry not just your body along, but your will.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps,
&gt; 
&gt; Reinhard

&gt; &gt; Since this group has been so quiet I will assume you
&gt; &gt; have all been too
&gt; &gt; busy exploring the great out doors in the lovely
&gt; &gt; summer weather. I
&gt; &gt; should be thoroughly flogged, aside from walking to
&gt; &gt; church and walking
&gt; &gt; to the store when I ran out of laundry soap last
&gt; &gt; week I have not
&gt; &gt; walked with a purpose Since school let out. I am so
&gt; &gt; bad. Any tips on
&gt; &gt; avoiding the oops, I missed my walk again syndrome.
