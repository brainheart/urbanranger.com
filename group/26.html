&quot;If I exorcise my devils then my angels may leave too&quot; -Tom Waits

Reinhard I was re-reading urban ranger.com and enjoying your peptalk.
I will be urban rangering both tomorrow during Richards soccer 
game...I will just watch the game while walking in circles around 
the field, not exactly purposeful but still better than sedentary. 
Then on Sunday, weather permitting we will go tramping through the 
mud and crunchy falling leaves at our beautiful woodland park (has 
about a 2 mile perimeter)
So the above quote is from a Tom Waits song, and the reason I put it 
here is that while re-perusing the UR site, I noticed that not only 
did you graciously change/omit the aforementioned &quot;p&quot; word, it seems 

you have eliminated one of my absolute favorite lines about, 
something something....running around looking like a BOZO...
I loved that word :) It was so mockalicious!
Please, please, I am hoping you put it back in :)
I should have never tampered with your unedited style...That's what 
I really love about your stuff :)
Also I love the line in your UR poem about &quot;investing the pavements 

with diamond recollections&quot; That is fantastic!
Have a great weekend. Hope the baby and Engels fam is doing well.
I am on a posting spree...this is my 6th today.
Definitely hypomanic. LOL
Hope it's still ok with you :)
Peace,
Deb
