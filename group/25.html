&gt; Hi Deb,
&gt; 
&gt; You're not the first person to have complained about
&gt; the P word (the first person was poster #2, actually).
&gt; I'll remove it, but I feel compelled to give it a
&gt; little self-justifying funeral oration.

(sounds of drum processional and Dies Ire in background...)

&gt; 
&gt; First off, the W word, is etymologically just as bad,
&gt; though not nearly as punchy or flavorful:

Yes, Wuss is pretty lame as an alternative and definitely lacks 
punch....There is some underlying anger about the word Pussy (when 
not used as a euphemism for a very popular body part), which brings 
up images of the &quot;mean male chauvenist&quot; trying to make a man out of 

someone by saying &quot;what are you some kind of pussy&quot;...In the same 

instance inflecting both anger towards women and possibly hints of 
homophobia and hate.... I really do feel that you should be as 
punchy and flavorful as you can be, but not everyone has to be 
Howard Stern to create excitement or get the interest of the 
testosterone laden male internet surfer. Thanks for not being upset 
and I think you will attract more people this way...It is impossible 
not to offend everyone everywhere and I am really anti-censorship, 
but thanks for considering my feelings, and r0x0r too.. LOL :)

&gt; I've put up a chaster home page, but I'll keep the old
&gt; version for foul mouth purists here:

....Don't get me wrong, I love curse words, they can be very 
rewarding at times when saying &quot;you lousey inconsiderate person&quot; 

just doesn't do the trick...We can't all be Ned Flanders and walk 
around saying 
&quot;son of a didley&quot; when we stub our toe (a situation which requires a 

curse). I used to adore the George Carlin &quot;seven words you can't 
say on TV&quot; and it was somewhat of a mantra between myself and my 
silly friends :)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for speaking up (and welcome to your 4th
&gt; everyday systems group!). Give my regards to Richard,
&gt; and tell him it's now safe for him to look at the
&gt; site.

....I will put it on his list of Parentally approved sites :)
Actually, last night, Richard was on a cursing bender of his own (I 
told you I am not a perfect role model)
and decided to walk back and forth chanting &quot;Dick Cheney is a Dick&quot;.
and the day before he tryed his hand at shocking me by shamelessly 
flaunting his mastery of the &quot;F&quot; word...He also has his heart set on 

getting an earring by his ninth birthday in March...I told 
him, &quot;wouldn't it be better to wait till you have at least some 
facial hair or something?&quot;, as he still has the quintessential 
babyface, and of course when I did a little cool investigating I 
found out what was at the root of his earring desire...What 
else?,,,a girl! Help me Lord :) I thought puberty was supposed to 
be a couple more years, but I guess there may be pressure on todays 
younger generation to grow up a little faster. I kindof hope 
he &quot;forgets&quot; about it but I'll cross that bridge when we get 
there...

It felt nice to go for a walk today and I almost didn't feel it 
since my mind was on getting that clutch fluid and getting back 
fast...purposeful walking....
Peace,
Deb
