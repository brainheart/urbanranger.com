Welcome, horzarules.

I'm thrilled to see urban ranger sites are
proliferating (internationally!) and I like your take
on it. No poem, but more poetry. I like the whole
&quot;choosing to like it&quot; bit, redeeming something
necessary and &quot;bad&quot; into something perhaps even better
than the bluntly good. It's spiritual. Not bad for an
aerobic exercise routine! 

We should link to each others pages, give each other a
tad more google pagerank. Deal?

Looking forward to more &quot;glimpses,&quot;

&gt; 
&gt; Hello
&gt; 
&gt; I was scanning the net the previous days searching
&gt; for something 
&gt; related to the urban ranger principle, that has been
&gt; on my mind for 
&gt; some years now. Finding Mr.Engels'site brought some
&gt; sense to my 
&gt; otherwise fuzzy ideas about urban rangers. I must
&gt; admit it wasn't the 
&gt; health and exercise data that did it for me, but the
&gt; little poem at 
&gt; the beginning, which, I must admit, even if it's not
&gt; the most 
&gt; beautyful piece of poetry i've ever read , it
&gt; definetly sums up the 
&gt; urban ranger concept the way I see it. 
&gt; 
&gt; I made up this little site called
&gt; www.urbanranger.home.ro that you 
&gt; cand view at any time ( and i really invite you to,
&gt; because if i 
&gt; don't get enough visitors they'll close it ;) ),
&gt; that is ment to be a 
&gt; more elaborate approach to the whole ranger thing.
&gt; It encompasses 
&gt; some emotional, spiritual side that mere exercise
&gt; doesn't cover.
&gt; 
&gt; I live in the country's capital so it's rhythms and
&gt; flows are more 
&gt; easily perceptible but I think that with some
&gt; dedication anyone 
&gt; can &quot;commune&quot; with his/her city no matter the city's
&gt; size or activity 
&gt; level. ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Have a nice stroll!
&gt; Love your city! 
&gt; 
&gt;
