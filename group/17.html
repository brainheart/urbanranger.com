Hi Melanie,

I think taking the kids to the park could be an
excellent &quot;purposeful&quot; excursion. The trick is: can
you make it regular enough? I think it's so important
to have a task that kicks in every day, that you don't
have to wrack your brains to come up with. Any other
local mom's interested in making the walk to the park
a daily ritual? It could be sort of a community
babysitting project, among other things. Another
possible additional excuse might be the &quot;get away
walk,&quot; to get outside and take a daily (say) twenty
minute sanity-restorative walk away from the kids if
dad can handle them that long.

We've got our first due in September, so do me a favor
and keep track of what works!

Best of luck and continue to keep us posted,

Reinhard

&gt; currently I am a stay at home Mom. You would think
&gt; I could get enough
&gt; exercise chasing after my 7,5,3,and 1 year olds, but
&gt; no. As someone
&gt; once put it, &quot;it may be work but it sure aint
&gt; exercise. Maybe I will
&gt; just call some friends and see if they want to walk
&gt; to the park nearby
&gt; with my kids and theirs. who knows maybe I could
&gt; make it fun,picnic
&gt; and all. thanx for the advice. Your friend in

&gt; &gt; Hi Melanie,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think the critical thing, as with no s, is not
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; fixate on one off excuses to do the right thing
&gt; (these
&gt; &gt; are great as a supplement), but to build a
&gt; regular,
&gt; &gt; daily habit. You don't want to have to think
&gt; &quot;where
&gt; &gt; and when should I walk today?&quot; every day. It
&gt; should be
&gt; &gt; routine. Your feet should know. Can you walk to
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; from work? That's ideal. Maybe do less once a
&gt; month
&gt; &gt; mega-shopping and walk to the store to buy at
&gt; least
&gt; &gt; some of your dinner fresh every day (you may also
&gt; find
&gt; &gt; this helps a lot with planning sensible meals). If
&gt; &gt; there is no one errand you could arrange to have
&gt; to do
&gt; &gt; every day, then at least be sure to start moving
&gt; at a
&gt; &gt; certain time. You'll think better in motion; a
&gt; &gt; destination will occur to you.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The nice thing about walking is that because it's
&gt; so
&gt; &gt; pleasant, you don't need as much willpower as
&gt; with,
&gt; &gt; say, jogging, to get started each day. But it
&gt; still
&gt; &gt; requires some. You need to take it seriously. Make
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; non-optional, a top priority. As with diet, the
&gt; hard
&gt; &gt; part is at the beginning. Once it's a habit, your
&gt; feet
&gt; &gt; carry not just your body along, but your will.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hope this helps,
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Since this group has been so quiet I will assume
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; have all been too
&gt; &gt; &gt; busy exploring the great out doors in the lovely
&gt; &gt; &gt; summer weather. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; should be thoroughly flogged, aside from walking
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; church and walking
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the store when I ran out of laundry soap last
&gt; &gt; &gt; week I have not
&gt; &gt; &gt; walked with a purpose Since school let out. I
&gt; am so
&gt; &gt; &gt; bad. Any tips on
&gt; &gt; &gt; avoiding the oops, I missed my walk again
&gt; syndrome.
