Hi Melanie,

I think the critical thing, as with no s, is not to
fixate on one off excuses to do the right thing (these
are great as a supplement), but to build a regular,
daily habit. You don't want to have to think &quot;where
and when should I walk today?&quot; every day. It should be
routine. Your feet should know. Can you walk to and
from work? That's ideal. Maybe do less once a month
mega-shopping and walk to the store to buy at least
some of your dinner fresh every day (you may also find
this helps a lot with planning sensible meals). If
there is no one errand you could arrange to have to do
every day, then at least be sure to start moving at a
certain time. You'll think better in motion; a
destination will occur to you.

The nice thing about walking is that because it's so
pleasant, you don't need as much willpower as with,
say, jogging, to get started each day. But it still
requires some. You need to take it seriously. Make it
non-optional, a top priority. As with diet, the hard
part is at the beginning. Once it's a habit, your feet
carry not just your body along, but your will.

Hope this helps,

Reinhard

&gt; busy exploring the great out doors in the lovely
&gt; summer weather. I
&gt; should be thoroughly flogged, aside from walking to
&gt; church and walking
&gt; to the store when I ran out of laundry soap last
&gt; week I have not
&gt; walked with a purpose Since school let out. I am so
&gt; bad. Any tips on
&gt; avoiding the oops, I missed my walk again syndrome.
