I have been a member of NoS for over a month maybe 2,I don't remember
when I joined. My healthiest times of my life I was an Urban Ranger
or Rather a Suburban ranger and didn't know it. I have a phobia of
driving so Driving isn't a problem for me. My philosophy has always
been never ride when I can just as easily walk. I may need to plan
ahead and put the extra minutes into my schedule to get there, but I
will get there just the same. I know you are anti- treadmills here,
but living in an area where it is frequently bad weather, I am
seriously considering, saving my money and buying a manual treadmill.
Currently my stradegy for no walk days has been,to step up and down
on this mini-pallet my husband brought home from work(they were just
going to throw it away) While I watch my favorite shows on T.v. I am
not that consistant at it but I hope to be better. I hope to get a
lot of advice and support from this group and give both in equal
measure. Your friend in health Melanie
