&gt; Inter-office walking sounds like a good start. I read
&gt; that many companies are building new office buildings
&gt; with wide, well lit stairs and really slow elevators,

&gt; not work miracles in itself, but it's something, and
&gt; it's a start. It's a signal and a reinforcement of a
&gt; new attentive-determination to find ways to walk.
&gt; Keeping at it is a good in itself, maybe a small good,
&gt; but nourishes a faculty that is likely to find others.

....Hi Reinhard and Navin and all the Office Rangers out there :)
The best shape I have been in in all my adult life, was when I was a 
food delivery person...I did that for two years while Richard was a 
little toddler and I only wished to work in a part time 
capacity..Well, all the clients were in these large industrial 
parks.... I estimated that the stairs alone added up to about 15 to 
20 flights a day...I never took the elevator, unless I was totally 
exhausted or in a huge rush...And I also had to walk long distances 
from the parking lots to the buildings themselves....a form 
of &quot;inter office&quot; walking... Yes, Reinhard, you are right that it is 

a small good, but lots of small goods add up to big results... I was 
pretty proud of my figure back then... It was part of my work so 
there was no &quot;sneaking out of it&quot; as I have come to be now.... It 

was a no brainer, which is why it worked for me (a sad testament to 
what brains will do, sometimes when left to their own, self 
destructive devices! LOL)
And also, you are right about how the good results &quot;bled over&quot; into 

other areas of self improvement... I was much more conscious of my 
eating during that 2 year period because I wanted that exercise to 
count and not get obliterated by poor eating habits...
Maybe I need to find another delivery job :)
Love,
Deb
