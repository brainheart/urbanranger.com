Thanks for the welcome,I guess I need to define my idea of bad
weather. I define bad weather as a current unrelenting, windy, snow
and or thunder and lighting storm. Both of which we experienced
this past week. Nasty business, a young girl was even hit by
lightning. I agree gloomy, overcast, even foggy weather is romantic,
and mysterious. There is nothing I love more than to walk right after
a big storm as long as the storm is passed. I just do the walk indoors
thing when I don't want to sink up to my hips in snow or come home
looking like a wet mop head. And your right having the phobia does
help. I bought my house Mainly because of it's relatively close
proximity to a number of stores, schools, and my church. As luck
would have it there is a track and park right next to my childrens
school. Lately I have been walking them to and from school and as an
added measure go around the track, which I happen to know is one mile,
at least once before walking home after dropping them off and picking
them up. I can even extend my walk on the days I am feeling good by
weaving up and down the neighborhood streets. instead of taking the
direct route. your friend in health Melanie

&gt; Welcome, suburban ranger! I think folks in the suburbs
&gt; are probably in even more need of walking than us city
&gt; dwellers. It's good (in this regard, at least) that
&gt; you have a phobia of driving, that's a start!
&gt; 
&gt; Don't worry, I'm not going to go on an anti-treadmill
&gt; tirade. It's certainly much better than just sitting
&gt; around. And if you use it to supplement and not merely
&gt; replace outdoor walking, I don't have a problem with
&gt; it. But I'll do my urban ranger duty and plug a little
&gt; more for outdoor walking, despite obstacles:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Dreary weather can be romantic. The weather in
&gt; Germany and the UK is notoriously miserable, and yet
&gt; these are great walking nations. Romanticism might
&gt; require a bit more imagination in some soulless suburb
&gt; than it would walking by a castle on the Rhine, but
&gt; that's what imagination's for.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Though I don't live in a suburb myself, my dad
&gt; does, as do my in-laws, and I've found that there are
&gt; a surprising amount of places you can actually walk
&gt; to, and that some of these walks are actually rather
&gt; nice. So while you may not be able to walk to work, or
&gt; walk to do *all* your errands, do consider whether you
&gt; might not be able to walk to do *some* of them. And
&gt; don't just consider, explore a little. Make it an
&gt; adventure.
&gt; 
&gt; Best of luck, and keep us posted,
&gt;

&gt; &gt; I have been a member of NoS for over a month maybe
&gt; &gt; 2,I don't remember
&gt; &gt; when I joined. My healthiest times of my life I was
&gt; &gt; an Urban Ranger
&gt; &gt; or Rather a Suburban ranger and didn't know it. I
&gt; &gt; have a phobia of
&gt; &gt; driving so Driving isn't a problem for me. My
&gt; &gt; philosophy has always
&gt; &gt; been never ride when I can just as easily walk. I
&gt; &gt; may need to plan
&gt; &gt; ahead and put the extra minutes into my schedule to
&gt; &gt; get there, but I
&gt; &gt; will get there just the same. I know you are anti-
&gt; &gt; treadmills here,
&gt; &gt; but living in an area where it is frequently bad
&gt; &gt; weather, I am
&gt; &gt; seriously considering, saving my money and buying a
&gt; &gt; manual treadmill.
&gt; &gt; Currently my stradegy for no walk days has been,to
&gt; &gt; step up and down
&gt; &gt; on this mini-pallet my husband brought home from
&gt; &gt; work(they were just
&gt; &gt; going to throw it away) While I watch my favorite
&gt; &gt; shows on T.v. I am
&gt; &gt; not that consistant at it but I hope to be better. 
&gt; &gt; I hope to get a
&gt; &gt; lot of advice and support from this group and give
&gt; &gt; both in equal
&gt; &gt; measure. Your friend in health Melanie
