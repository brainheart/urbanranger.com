Ideally, an urban ranger doesn't have to make extra
time to walk, it's part of his commute. If it's a work
day, he's walking. I'm lucky in that my job is close
enough to home that this is easy. It's so close, in
fact, that it almost isn't enough. And so, as I've
mentioned, I also take mostly aimless &quot;lunch walks&quot;
during the day.

But the last few months have been busy and stressful
and I've often missed a lunch walk. So I've now
resolved to not let that happen anymore. I will never
miss a lunch walk, no matter how busy work gets, no
matter how soon I have to run home to baby. There's no
con to it. Because if I don't take the time to take a
lunchwalk, I'm guaranteed to just waste an equal if
not greater amount of time in disgruntled
procrastination or inefficient stupidity in front of
the computer.

I won't always be able to squeeze in my original 55
minutes. But 30 should never be a problem. Getting out
the door should never be a problem, and once I've done
that, the battle is three quarters won, I have a whole
new perspective. I won't even worry about &quot;how long&quot;
until I'm out. The only requirement as far as my
resolution is concerned is to just get out.

So for all you urban ranger slackers, who don't/can't
walk as part of your necessary daily routines, and opt
for the optional walk all too infrequently, make them
less optional. Make them not at all optional. A set
time helps. Consider lunchwalking. Gets the blood
flowing. You'll be a healthier, happier, better worker
when you get back to your desk.
