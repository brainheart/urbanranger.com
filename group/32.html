I wandered over to this site after being on the No-S group for a
while. The Urban Ranger concept is pretty good. I've been running
into many practical issues though. I'm not really in the city, and
I'm not really in the suburb. I'm kind of on a strange semi-rural
stretch of road that is not very friendly to walking. While work is
only about 1.5 miles away, there are no sidewalks and a fair amount of
traffic. I've walked to work... once... around the holidays when
there is not as much traffic, but it wasn't the greatest walk in the
world.

I have found some ways to add walking to my day, though. There are
multiple buildings at work, and the occasional time I need to go
between buildings, I just walk (and sometimes am quicker than my
co-workers who drive!) I don't use the office phone a lot... if I
need to talk to somebody, I just walk over there. And use the stairs
instead of the elevator.

Any others come up with good tips at getting a little more walking
into the routine when walking to/from work or the store isn't very
practical?

Perhaps there should be an Urban Biker group... while my street sucks
for walking, it isn't too bad to bike down. Although I'd be afaid the
term &quot;urban biker&quot; might have different connotations.

Okay, I'm done rambling now.
