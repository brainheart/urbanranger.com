Wow. You're right, that sounds more like
&quot;action/adventure&quot; weather than romance :-). Still, I
imagine it's on the rare side.

It sounds like you're very well set up for purposeful
walking.

Keep us posted,

Reinhard

&gt; Thanks for the welcome,I guess I need to define my
&gt; idea of bad
&gt; weather. I define bad weather as a current
&gt; unrelenting, windy, snow
&gt; and or thunder and lighting storm. Both of which
&gt; we experienced
&gt; this past week. Nasty business, a young girl was
&gt; even hit by
&gt; lightning. I agree gloomy, overcast, even foggy
&gt; weather is romantic,
&gt; and mysterious. There is nothing I love more than
&gt; to walk right after
&gt; a big storm as long as the storm is passed. I just
&gt; do the walk indoors
&gt; thing when I don't want to sink up to my hips in
&gt; snow or come home
&gt; looking like a wet mop head. And your right having
&gt; the phobia does
&gt; help. I bought my house Mainly because of it's
&gt; relatively close
&gt; proximity to a number of stores, schools, and my
&gt; church. As luck
&gt; would have it there is a track and park right next
&gt; to my childrens
&gt; school. Lately I have been walking them to and from
&gt; school and as an
&gt; added measure go around the track, which I happen to
&gt; know is one mile,
&gt; at least once before walking home after dropping
&gt; them off and picking
&gt; them up. I can even extend my walk on the days I am
&gt; feeling good by
&gt; weaving up and down the neighborhood streets. 
&gt; instead of taking the
&gt; direct route. your friend in health Melanie

&gt; &gt; Welcome, suburban ranger! I think folks in the
&gt; suburbs
&gt; &gt; are probably in even more need of walking than us
&gt; city
&gt; &gt; dwellers. It's good (in this regard, at least)
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; you have a phobia of driving, that's a start!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Don't worry, I'm not going to go on an
&gt; anti-treadmill
&gt; &gt; tirade. It's certainly much better than just
&gt; sitting
&gt; &gt; around. And if you use it to supplement and not
&gt; merely
&gt; &gt; replace outdoor walking, I don't have a problem
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; it. But I'll do my urban ranger duty and plug a
&gt; little
&gt; &gt; more for outdoor walking, despite obstacles:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1. Dreary weather can be romantic. The weather in
&gt; &gt; Germany and the UK is notoriously miserable, and
&gt; yet
&gt; &gt; these are great walking nations. Romanticism might
&gt; &gt; require a bit more imagination in some soulless
&gt; suburb
&gt; &gt; than it would walking by a castle on the Rhine,
&gt; but
&gt; &gt; that's what imagination's for.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2. Though I don't live in a suburb myself, my dad
&gt; &gt; does, as do my in-laws, and I've found that there
&gt; are
&gt; &gt; a surprising amount of places you can actually
&gt; walk
&gt; &gt; to, and that some of these walks are actually
&gt; rather
&gt; &gt; nice. So while you may not be able to walk to
&gt; work, or
&gt; &gt; walk to do *all* your errands, do consider whether
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; might not be able to walk to do *some* of them.
&gt; And
&gt; &gt; don't just consider, explore a little. Make it an
&gt; &gt; adventure.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Best of luck, and keep us posted,
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been a member of NoS for over a month
&gt; maybe
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2,I don't remember
&gt; &gt; &gt; when I joined. My healthiest times of my life I
&gt; was
&gt; &gt; &gt; an Urban Ranger
&gt; &gt; &gt; or Rather a Suburban ranger and didn't know it. 
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; have a phobia of
&gt; &gt; &gt; driving so Driving isn't a problem for me. My
&gt; &gt; &gt; philosophy has always
&gt; &gt; &gt; been never ride when I can just as easily walk. 
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; may need to plan
&gt; &gt; &gt; ahead and put the extra minutes into my schedule
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; get there, but I
&gt; &gt; &gt; will get there just the same. I know you are
&gt; anti-
&gt; &gt; &gt; treadmills here,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but living in an area where it is frequently bad
&gt; &gt; &gt; weather, I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; seriously considering, saving my money and
&gt; buying a
&gt; &gt; &gt; manual treadmill.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Currently my stradegy for no walk days has
&gt; been,to
&gt; &gt; &gt; step up and down
&gt; &gt; &gt; on this mini-pallet my husband brought home from
&gt; &gt; &gt; work(they were just
&gt; &gt; &gt; going to throw it away) While I watch my
&gt; favorite
&gt; &gt; &gt; shows on T.v. I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; not that consistant at it but I hope to be
&gt; better. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope to get a
&gt; &gt; &gt; lot of advice and support from this group and
&gt; give
&gt; &gt; &gt; both in equal
&gt; &gt; &gt; measure. Your friend in health Melanie
