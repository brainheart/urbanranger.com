I got one of those mcdonalds pedometers the other day 
those salads are actually quite filling when you drink all the water 
and have a peice of fruit with it.

Anyhow i wore the pedometer to work and set if the minute i cahsed in 
and checked it at the time we cashed out. I took 8416 steps.
That is not steady walking so it does not have the exercise quality 
to it.. but if i could add just 4000 steps of steady walking to that 
a day i would be doing good!

&gt; In a nutshell:
&gt; 
&gt; As part of a recent study, 96 members of an old order 
&gt; Amish community in Ontario were given pedometers to
&gt; measure how much they walked. The men averaged about
&gt; 18,000 steps a day, the women 14,000. Their obesity
&gt; rate was just 4% (2 individuals).
&gt; 
&gt; By contrast, even Americans who are dedicated walkers
&gt; have trouble exceeding 10,000 steps a day. The average
&gt; American manages a mere 2,000 to 5,000. The United
&gt; States has an obesity rate of over 30%.

&gt; 
&gt; Obviously, walking is just one factor. These Amish
&gt; spend hours a day tossing around bales of hay, etc.
&gt; But they also really pack it away at meals. I think
&gt; this astonishing disparity in walking has got to be
&gt; significant. It is also, unlike the bales of hay, more
&gt; easily replicable for us &quot;English.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I'm cross posting this to the urbanranger group
&gt; (because it's more relevant) and to the nosdiet group
&gt; (because it's still relevant and I actually want
&gt; someone to read it). My apologies (and gratitude) to
&gt; the few who are members of both.
&gt; 
&gt; I think I'm going to invest in a pedometer, just to
&gt; see how this urban ranger is currently doing...
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, and for those who are concerned, &quot;use of the
&gt; pedometers and scales did not violate Amish traditions
&gt; because they were borrowed.&quot; (Harvard article)
