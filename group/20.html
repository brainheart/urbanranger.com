Welcome, marshtrillium.

I love bikes. They're such a brilliant invention. I
can't believe all the fuss about the &quot;Segway Human
Transporter&quot; when the 200 year old bicycle is
cheaper, faster, less cumbersome, totally clean
environmentally, and gives you a great workout in the
process. Cities should be designed around *them.*

I used to bike to and from work but I live so close
that I didn't really feel like I was getting any
exercise (20 minute walk vs. 5 minute bike). And
though I enjoy biking, it requires a certain amount of
concentration lest you get doored or smushed by a bus.
I relish the (relatively) safe thinking time walking
affords me every morning and evening, it's one of the
chief reasons I do it. My wife and I still take
leisurely bike rides now and then. If we weren't just
a few minutes walk from pretty much about everywhere
we ever go we'd bike more often.

Sorry to hear about your back. Hope walking does the
trick, and that this group helps you stick with it.

Keep us posted,

Reinhard

&gt; And wanted to say hi.
&gt; 
&gt; I ride a bike to work and for most errands. Biking
&gt; is better than 
&gt; driving, and it's kept my fitness level from
&gt; declining even more 
&gt; under the onslaught of terrible eating habits and a
&gt; desk job, but it 
&gt; definitely doesn't help the RSI pain in my wrists or
&gt; lower back 
&gt; problems. And, since I get on my bike in our front
&gt; yard and park it 
&gt; right by the door at work, I actually walk less than
&gt; my coworkers who 
&gt; commute by car or train - the day I wore a pedometer
&gt; I only walked 
&gt; about 450 steps between leaving home in the morning
&gt; and getting back 
&gt; in the evening. So this summer while it's light late
&gt; in the evening, 
&gt; I've been walking for an hour or so after dinner -
&gt; when I can 
&gt; motivate myself to do it.
&gt; 
&gt; I took a long train trip last year and really messed
&gt; up my back in a 
&gt; way that flares up again if I neglect my stretching
&gt; &amp; walking. So I'm 
&gt; really trying to get into a walking habit and hoping
&gt; this group will 
&gt; help.
