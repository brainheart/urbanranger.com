Hi Guys and Reinhard :)
This morning I thought my son looked sick and should stay home from 
school, and last night he had all kinds of stomach pain, plus his 
eyes were as dialated as two giant black saucers, and the whites 
were not white, but very red... Looked pretty sick to me, so we 
planned on him just sleeping in today.. well we moved back to my 
moms last Sept because of financial woes, and she has made every 
effort to make it an uncomfortable experience.. It's too bad...
Well anyway, she went ballistic on me before I even opened my eyes, 
from out in the hallway saying how &quot;Ridiculous&quot; it is for him to 

stay home etc.... blah blah blah!!!!!!!
Pre coffee ranting from her, tends to develop into me waking up 
ready to strangle someone... It isn't fun to wake up that way.
After a late start Richard had some vitamin C and some breakfast and 
I just decided to bring him to school after all, since he looked 
better after a bit of time...
Frustrated and pissed off, I needed to wander in my beloved woods 
(See Debs file in UrbanRanger for 2004 Autumn photos of this great 
park! :)
My forearms are really hurting today people, from a combo of cold 
weather, a bunch of massages I did, and SG too, so walking was a 
better aerobic choice for me than, say smashing the living daylights 
out of some random victim...
I decided to seek out, and shlep dead wood into my car, for a 
weekend fire to cheer me up... What a great workout this turned out 
to be! Very purposeful, outdoorsy, and I got to practice my &quot;Jean 

Claude Van Deb&quot; karate kicks to break the wood... I was dragging 10 

foot tree limbs to a &quot;kicking&quot; zone, and then breaking them with my 

foot... (next time I have to remember boots and jeans, not sneakers 
and stretchy leggings, for better leg protection)
Between the dragging limbs, looking around in circles, stacking the 
wood on my porch from my car, I managed to do about 35 minutes of 
constant movement, at times really getting a good sweat!
I have enough wood here now, for a small funeral pyre.
It was a good use of angry energy :)
So, not a purist Urban Ranger workout, but very purposeful and fun!
Especially the kicking stuff
Hahya!
Deb
