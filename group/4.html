In a nutshell:

As part of a recent study, 96 members of an old order 
Amish community in Ontario were given pedometers to
measure how much they walked. The men averaged about
18,000 steps a day, the women 14,000. Their obesity
rate was just 4% (2 individuals).

By contrast, even Americans who are dedicated walkers
have trouble exceeding 10,000 steps a day. The average
American manages a mere 2,000 to 5,000. The United
States has an obesity rate of over 30%.

Obviously, walking is just one factor. These Amish
spend hours a day tossing around bales of hay, etc.
But they also really pack it away at meals. I think
this astonishing disparity in walking has got to be
significant. It is also, unlike the bales of hay, more
easily replicable for us &quot;English.&quot;

I'm cross posting this to the urbanranger group
(because it's more relevant) and to the nosdiet group
(because it's still relevant and I actually want
someone to read it). My apologies (and gratitude) to
the few who are members of both.

I think I'm going to invest in a pedometer, just to
see how this urban ranger is currently doing...

Oh, and for those who are concerned, &quot;use of the
pedometers and scales did not violate Amish traditions
because they were borrowed.&quot; (Harvard article)
