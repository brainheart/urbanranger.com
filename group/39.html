Hey folks :)
Dietwise, today was a bomb for me... I totally overdosed on home 
made vegetable soup... I was so uncomfortable for the past three 
hours, and really disappointed with myself for it, but you know what?
I could have used that depressed &quot;I suck&quot; feeling to ditch SG, and I 

didn't!!!
Just finished now. I thought I'd post this new move, which I 
consider to be pretty gosh darn hard... I'd love you all to try it 
out and let me know if it makes you cry for mercy! :)
Most of the SG moves are up/down forward/backward... Not knocking 
this at all, but you are only moving in one plane of motion... Once 
your arms get used to these movements it's nice to challenge them 
some more by adding another plane of movement...So I don't have a 
name, and it isn't really an &quot;everyday&quot; movement but, oh well.
What you do is: hold the SG handle horizontal at waist height
then use the weighted end to draw imaginary figure eights in the 
air, but the figure eights are in a horizontal plane also.. I think 
this is also the Greek letter Theta? Symbol of life :) (I think, 
but please feel free to correct me if I'm remembering wrong, it does 
happen)
..so you are scooping forward and then fluidly reversing the motion 
backwards..No chopping no swinging. Even and controlled.
I couldn't do more than a couple on either side before I was 
thinking &quot;No more!!&quot;
It's hard I tell you :)
Who's out there today? Do I hear a Khaki Joe? Brittany Spears 
illegitimate father? Spoctopid Kai? Raw Food Art? :)
And of course,
Reinhard :)
Peace,
Deb
