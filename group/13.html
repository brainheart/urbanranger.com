Some ideas on how you can find time to get exercise
The Daily Herald

The harried lifestyles many of us lead today often provide the excuse, 

&quot;I
don't have time to exercise.&quot;

We may not have time to train for a marathon, but we do have time to
increase the amount of physical activity in our daily routines. 
Fifteen
minutes of brisk activity twice a day is a good place to start. Once 
you
begin to feel the benefits of increased activity, you can find time to 

add
more activities.

Just why do we need to get moving? Because physical activity can help 
lower
risk of a heart attack, control weight and blood pressure and improve 
bone
density.
According to the American Heart Association, exercise helps control 
blood
lipid abnormalities, diabetes and obesity. Aerobic exercise also has 
an
independent, modest blood-pressure-lowering effect for certain groups 
of
people with high blood pressure.

Additionally, research indicates that people who modify their behavior 

and
exercise regularly after heart attack hve better rates of survival and 

a
better quality of life.

Set a goal for you and your children to get at least 30 minutes of 
physical
activity a day, three to four days a week. Fitting physical activities 

into
your daily routine is easy if you follow some simple tips for success:

. Take a walk.

. Walk or bike to the corner store instead of driving.

. Jog around the block.

. When watching TV, sit up instead of lying on the sofa. Better yet, 
spend a
few minutes pedaling on your stationary bicycle. Throw away your 
remote
control; get up to change the channel.

. Park farther away at the shopping mall and walk the extra distance.

. Turn on some music and dance.

. Take 10-minute breaks with your kids while they're doing their 
homework or
watching television to walk, dance or otherwise exercise.

. At the office, take the stairs instead of the elevator. Or get off a 

few
floors early and take the stairs the rest of the way.

. Get off the bus a few blocks early and walk the rest of the way to 
wrk or
home.

. Walk around your building for a break during the workday or during 
lunch.

Physical fitness is not a destination, but a journey - a way of life. 
By
making physical activity part of your life, you can improve the way 
you
look, feel and work. Whether it is a structured exercise program or 
just
part of your daily routine, all exercise adds up to a healthier heart.
