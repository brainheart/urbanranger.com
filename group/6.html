Thanks for posting this, Kitrin.

I don't think the Amish numbers are all steady
walking, either (though you're right, that probably is
better).

10,000 seems to be the the realistic daily minimum
target recommended by most walking sites, so you're
not far off.

It's interesting that the one day of the week the
Amish averaged less than 10,000 (and not much less)
was Sunday, the day of rest. It's kind of sad that by
Amish standards our whole week is one of (albeit
profane) rest.

I'll post my number Monday. I'm hoping I'll be happy
enough with it not to have to measure again, since I
walk pretty much the same route every weekday, and
fascinating as this whole pedometer business is, I can
imagine getting sick of it fast.

&gt; I got one of those mcdonalds pedometers the other

&gt; those salads are actually quite filling when you

&gt; 
&gt; Anyhow i wore the pedometer to work and set if the
&gt; minute i cahsed in 
&gt; and checked it at the time we cashed out. I took
&gt; 8416 steps.
&gt; That is not steady walking so it does not have the
&gt; exercise quality 
&gt; to it.. but if i could add just 4000 steps of steady
&gt; walking to that 
&gt; a day i would be doing good!

&gt; &gt; In a nutshell:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As part of a recent study, 96 members of an old
&gt; &gt; order 
&gt; &gt; Amish community in Ontario were given pedometers
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; measure how much they walked. The men averaged
&gt; about
&gt; &gt; 18,000 steps a day, the women 14,000. Their
&gt; obesity
&gt; &gt; rate was just 4% (2 individuals).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; By contrast, even Americans who are dedicated
&gt; walkers
&gt; &gt; have trouble exceeding 10,000 steps a day. The
&gt; average
&gt; &gt; American manages a mere 2,000 to 5,000. The United
&gt; &gt; States has an obesity rate of over 30%.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Obviously, walking is just one factor. These Amish
&gt; &gt; spend hours a day tossing around bales of hay,
&gt; etc.
&gt; &gt; But they also really pack it away at meals. I
&gt; think
&gt; &gt; this astonishing disparity in walking has got to
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; significant. It is also, unlike the bales of hay,
&gt; more
&gt; &gt; easily replicable for us &quot;English.&quot;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm cross posting this to the urbanranger group
&gt; &gt; (because it's more relevant) and to the nosdiet
&gt; group
&gt; &gt; (because it's still relevant and I actually want
&gt; &gt; someone to read it). My apologies (and gratitude)
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; the few who are members of both.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think I'm going to invest in a pedometer, just
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; see how this urban ranger is currently doing...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Oh, and for those who are concerned, &quot;use of the
&gt; &gt; pedometers and scales did not violate Amish
&gt; traditions
&gt; &gt; because they were borrowed.&quot; (Harvard article)
